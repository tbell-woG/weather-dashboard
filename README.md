# About The Project
The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard application within the web browser that would retrieve, display, and save weather data for cities. This weather dashboard application is ideal for anyone who wants to know their local weather conditions. The weather dashboard displays the current forecast for the day, which includes the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It also displays the upcoming forecast for the next 5 days. It is possible for the weather dashboard to have the ability to display the weather condition through Application Programming Interfaces (API's). The Open Weather Map API was used in this app.
